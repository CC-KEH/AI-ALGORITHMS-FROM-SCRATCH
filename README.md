# Machine Learning Algorithms from Scratch

This repository features implementations of various machine learning algorithms coded from scratch in Python. The purpose of this project is to gain a deep understanding of the inner workings of these algorithms by creating them without the use of high-level libraries like scikit-learn. These implementations are also used to explain the functionality of these algorithms in my [machine learning blogs](https://cckeh.hashnode.dev/series/machine-learning).

## Algorithms Implemented

1. **Linear Regression**
2. **Logistic Regression**
3. **Decision Tree**
4. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
5. **Naive Bayes**
6. **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
7. **Random Forest**

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib (for visualization)
- Scikit-learn (for dataset access and comparison)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ml-algorithms-from-scratch.git
   cd ml-algorithms-from-scratch
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:

    ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install the required packages:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

Each algorithm has its own script. You can run these scripts to see the algorithm in action on example datasets. For instance, to run the Linear Regression algorithm, you can use the following command:

```bash
python Linear_Regression.py
```

## Future Work

I plan to add more algorithms to this repository in the future. Additionally, I will include more detailed explanations of each algorithm in their own separate folder, encompassing implementation code, theory, and more.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you have any improvements or new algorithms to add, feel free to open a pull request.
